# Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **Alx**. It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-malloc_checked.c` | allocates memory using malloc |
| `1-string_nconcat.c` | concatenates two strings |
| `2-calloc.c` | allocates memory for an array, using malloc |
| `3-array_range.c` | creates an array of integers. |
| 100-realloc.c`` | reallocates a memory block using malloc and free |
